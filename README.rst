=========

PySampler is a very simple package to produce many realisations of samples drawn from any probability distribution.

Feature list:

* **Sampler**: obtain a sample from any distribution.

* **Statistics**: from many realisations, compute the average and the standard deviation.

Check `examples`_ of how to use PySampler in different physics scenarios.
