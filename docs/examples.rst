Examples
========

In our repository you can find some `examples`_ that will help you to get started wit ``PySampler``.

You can get simulated data by drawing from different distributions. For example:

* Halo mass function:

* Schechter mass function:

* Planck distribution:

Choose your favorite distribution!
